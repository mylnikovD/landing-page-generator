# Simple landing page generator

This web app accepts user input text and picture and creates an HTML page based on that input. The generated page can be saved and downloaded in the .html format.
The features of the project use base64 conversion of image and inline styling to preserve the look of the page and the image content in single HTML output file. Also, the application structure follows the Atomic Design guidelines, separating the components into molecules, atoms and organisms based on their role.
